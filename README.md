xlrd test module


A series of python scripts designed to harvest and collate data from the ABS and RBA sources.

They rely heavily on the ABS and RBA file locations, and the 'named ranges' in excel to access the data, before processing it through pandas.  The output is periodised to handle variations in data publish dates.
